                                        We observed the journey as these beings crawled and wrapped themselves in a

                                        cocoon to rest and transform. I remember peering in the little box every day to
                                        admire
                                        the cocoons of mint green with gold edges as they hung from the ceiling of the
                                        cardboard.
                                        My heart was full with anticipation of when they would emerge.
